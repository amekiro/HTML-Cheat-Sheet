## Scope of project
The HTML cheat sheet is a project from the Full Stack Engineer track on Codecademy, started by Caitlyn Sun on December 29, 2021. Requirements for the project are:

- Use HTML and CSS to create a cheat sheet about an HTML/CSS topic (I decided to cover HTML5 specific syntax)
- Use table to document topics
- Use colors
- Customize page with CSS

This project is focused on HTML and CSS usage.
